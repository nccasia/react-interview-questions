## Q. What are semantic and non-semantic elements?

* **Semantic elements**: clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
For example: `<form>`, `<table>`,  `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<details>`, `<figcaption>`, `<figure>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<mark>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<summary>`, `<time>` clearly defines its content.
  
* **Non-semantic elements**: `<div>` and `<span>` tells nothing about its content.
